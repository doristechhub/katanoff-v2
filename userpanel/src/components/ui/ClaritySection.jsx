        No visible inclusions to the naked eye and, again, these are difficult
        to see even by a trained expert at 10x magnification. However, these
        inclusions are bigger, or there may be more of them, than seen in a VVS
        diamond. These diamonds offer good value for someone looking for a
        diamond engagement ring as the inclusions are still not visible to the
        naked eye.

        Diamonds are those whose imperfections are visible at 10x magnification.
        A typical SI diamond might have a cloud, a feather, and an included
        crystal of another mineral. Neither the diamondâ€™s transparency nor face
        up appearance may be affected by these inclusions.
